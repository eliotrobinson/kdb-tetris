# KDB Tetris

Usage:
```
q tetris.q

[ENTER] = rotate clockwise
[SPACE] + [ENTER] = drop
[A] + [ENTER] = left
[D] + [ENTER] = right
[S] + [ENTER] = soft drop
[N] + [ENTER] = start/restart level
[X] + [ENTER] = exit
```
KDB does not have an intuitive GUI, and such the gameplay can be very janky. I've found that running this on windows cmd is as smooth as it can get.
